Just a mod that adds a GUI element representing the parliament in BPM.
It updates every month. Wait until after the first election then the next month it should appear.
Currently there is no mechanics associated with this. Might change that if I have free time.
Also currently only the liberal, social (social democrat), conservative and agrarian party are implemented.
The graph will be shown in every country but it may be useless. Use at your own risk!
Also every country has 300 seats.
WAIT BUT THATS UNREALISTIC ok but im tired
kthxbye
