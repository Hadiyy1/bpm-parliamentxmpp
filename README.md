Just a mod that adds a GUI element representing the parliament in BPM.
It updates every month. (Might take a few months at game start, it won't spawn if you don't have elections ofc)
Currently there is no mechanics associated with this. Might change that if I have free time.
Also currently only the liberal, social (social democrat), conservative and agrarian party are implemented.
Also every country has 300 seats.
WAIT BUT THATS UNREALISTIC ok but im tired
kthxbye
